# A utility for deleting google cloud network load-balancers that are unattached to active
# kubernetes' services.
#
# This script is necessary due to bugs in GKE/Kubernetes right now (Feb 2017) that prevent
# gcloud load-balancer resource objects from being cleaned up properly.
#
# Note that a google "load-balancer" is not a single object, it is a combination of 3 objects:
# firewall-rule / forwarding-rule / target-pool. This script will try to delete all related objects.
# the objects following a common naming pattern so they're able to be linked by name.

#   $ PROJECT=fooproject \
#     REGION=us-central1 \
#     GKE_CLUSTER_NAME=cluster-01 \
